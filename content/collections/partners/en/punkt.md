        text: 'Since 2007, we have been engaged in the promotion and support of design, architecture and urbanism through interdisciplinary dialog. Our focus is on a comprehensive support for urban development, ranging from community development and development of the local economy, to the involvement of citizens in the planning processes. Our key activities include the Good Market event and the CTZN platform, which provides training and counseling in the field of ecology and participatory planning for the restoration of unused buildings or public spaces. We brought a PechaKucha Night to Slovakia and organized the Design Weekend and WhatCity.'
