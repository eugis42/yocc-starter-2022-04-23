        text: 'So, the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has launched a green remodeling program to improve the energy efficiency of older buildings and the quality of their indoor environments. Remodeling takes much less time than putting up new buildings, and it also costs less. Green remodeling is an environmentally friendly construction method that takes nature into consideration. It also increases the value of the building, improves the quality of the indoor living and working environment and reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.'

Between them lies Ganghwa Bay. On a clear day you can see the North Korean industrial region of Kaesong beyond the barbed wire fence. Byung Un Jung, the managing director of E-ECO Construction, a sustainable building company, had a very special house built for his mother, who’s from North Korea: from the rooftop, she can gaze longingly at her native country. He named it Friendly Duck House.'

Fascinated by its sturdy ridge-poles and curved rafters, Byung Un Jung thought long and hard about how to remodel the place in a way that would minimize energy loss whilst preserving the beauty of the old hanok. The result is his Friendly Duck House, which took first prize in the category “Residential Building” at the fifth Green Remodeling Best Practices Contest held by the Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Korea Land and Housing Corporation (LH). The contest is an architectural and cultural event that presents outstanding remodeling projects to the general public.'

And he preserved the beautiful features of the house, including the original rafters and ridge-poles, and had the ceiling coated with kaolin to bring out the lovely color of the wood. He also left some of the supporting elements he’d discovered in the loess walls standing. These supports are a mix of sorghum stalks and wood, and originally served as insulation to reduce energy loss. So the architects managed to preserve the old design and the original atmosphere of the house despite the remodeling.'

He fitted the exterior with urethane panels to keep the indoor temperature constant and prevent most of the heat loss. He used panels and airtight sealing and swelling tape to make the high-performance windows as airtight as possible. The heat-recovery ventilation system keeps the air circulating uniformly inside the house, minimizing heating and cooling requirements and creating a comfortable indoor climate. A roof overhang on the south side of the house blocks intense sunlight in summer, thereby reducing air conditioning requirements and electricity costs as a result.'

What’s more, there was hardly any room for the steadily growing number of books – let alone sufficient rest areas for the students. The dead load of the building itself (i.e. the intrinsic weight of the structure and fixtures) had increased so much over time that its structural stability was in jeopardy.'

The decentralized ventilation system with heat exchanger improves the indoor air quality and consumes half as much energy as conventional ventilation. And the new photovoltaic system (126 kW) generates over 142% of the total energy required for lighting. So the remodeling cut the library’s energy consumption by 53.4%, even qualifying for the highest energy efficiency rating (1+ under Korean standards) and for G-SEED (Green Standard for Energy & Environmental Design) certification {ist gar nicht klar, was Grade 4 bedeutet, ist aber vielleicht mittelmässig… Mangels näheren Erklärung würde ich “Grade 4” deshalb einfach weglassen, also schreiben: “… and for G-SEED certification”}.'

The white wedge-shaped roof projections, mounted along the façades like wings, reflect the sunlight into the interior in order to supply sufficient daylight. The electrically operated sunshade on the outside of the building automatically adjusts to changing weather conditions, such as temperature, sunshine and wind speed, thereby increasing the building’s energy efficiency as well. Furthermore, less energy is consumed for lighting by separately regulating the amount of light entering the interior.'
