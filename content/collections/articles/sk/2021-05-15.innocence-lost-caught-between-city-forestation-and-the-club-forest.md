        text: "It was by no means certain that artists would again take up trees and forests in the second half of the past century. After the perfidious instrumentalisation of the German forest by the National Socialists, it had become a taboo for representatives of the avant-garde. Lumberjacks occasional featured in the socialist realism of the German Democratic Republic, but nature only served as a backdrop. Evoking a sylvan idyll was left to trivial or local art in both East and West Germany, especially given that a very limited audience enjoyed contemplating likenesses of grunting deer and mountain forests crisscrossed by brooks above the settee. This kitschy portrayal was in keeping with the idealised world reflected in films like\_"

        text: 'When people talk about the forest today – and this is true of both literature and film – they speak from a place of fracture, either ironically or in connection to ongoing environmental destruction. No evocation of nationalism here. And when artist Eldar Farber, who commutes between Berlin and Tel Aviv, creates seemingly romantically signified forest landscapes, it is important to remember that his family survived the Holocaust and that his imaginings were shaped by their stories. Munich painter Ilana Lewitan is processing the fate of her father, who was able to flee the Nazis by hiding in a thicket. Yet Lewitan’s barren tree giants seem threatening, like gangs of murderers circling in an aggressive swagger. Sanctuary and horror collide in the forest as in a thriller. This ambivalence, which tends to the extreme in crime, makes the forest the most eerily mysterious setting of all, linked to the topos of the wilderness, the monstrous, but also of the primal, where human beings can retreat and become one with nature.'

Yet, it also stands for tranquillity and simplicity. Dutch artist Herman de Vries has lived in the Franconian Steiger Forest for 50 years. His art made of roots and leaves practically fall at his feet, and he doesn’t have to imbue them with meaning: “Nature is enough for itself and should also be enough for human beings”, is the credo of the almost 90-year-old. That would certainly be best for the forest.'
