The mixed-use building offers a combination of residential and business units over 18 storeys, making it not only the world’s tallest timber tower but also one of the tallest buildings in Norway. The dynamic façade seems to capture the soft morning light. But what’s a skyscraper doing out here in rural Norway, miles away from the nearest city?\_"

The wood used for the interior not only ensures a balanced indoor climate, but has also proved popular thanks to its design versatility. The minimalist aesthetics of the spiral staircase leading up to the second floor, at the centre of the restaurant, is an example of this.\_"

        text: "But the unique nature of this building can be attributed to more than (just) its finishes. In fact, it is more about the use and handling of, what is known as, cross laminated timber, a technique that makes it possible to overcome the limitations of traditional timber construction and to build multi-storey structures in wood, too. With this method architects were able to draw on experiences from a few years ago, when two eight-storey residential blocks were constructed at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Ås, near Oslo. On that project they needed a solution that would allow them to provide student residences quickly and cheaply. A task faced all over the world by almost all cities of any size nowadays, and something that is relevant as a general principle for creating affordable housing, as well as, student accommodation.\_"

He is a big fan of the cross laminated timber technique. “Cross laminated timber is when the planks of wood are arranged crosswise in layers and bonded together. This technique allows for the production of large-format, highly durable wooden building elements,” explains Aurlien. “We need to design our cities to be more sustainable, more robust, greener and safer. Building with timber can help us take some important steps in this direction,” he believes and in particular points out the significantly better CO2 balance of wood compared for instance with that of concrete.\_"

        text: "“Wood is a renewable raw material, but of course a good climate balance can only be achieved if you use local resources. However, timber is in the process of making a comeback in the building industry, so that, in the case of the Mjøstårnet construction project, it was already possible to use locally produced wood.” Answering the question of whether or not the fire risk in urban areas is significantly higher for timber buildings than for concrete, steel and glass, Aurlien refers to extensive tests with which it could be proven that the new wooden structures have outstanding fire resistance thanks to their high material density. Nevertheless, installation of sprinkler systems is of course a mandatory requirement – just as it is for the construction of any high-rise buildings. And they now have experience with regard to the possibility of water damage. “After water damage occurred shortly before the student block opened, all showers in the bathrooms were fitted with timed flow valves. So we’re learning all the time,” concludes Aurlien.\_"

Below the roof sculpture, nearly five metres high, making it a good metre-and-a-half taller than the HoHo in Vienna – another wooden skyscraper built at the same time – and allowing the Mjøstårnet to take the height record instead, there’s a panoramic view across the countryside. Ultimately, the greatest achievement of the property developers and engineers is that they kick-started the development of a new and sustainable construction method – and by 2041, at the latest, when the W350 Tower in Japan is scheduled for completion, with a planned height of 350 metres, the Norwegian timber skyscraper will have to relinquish its record.\_"
