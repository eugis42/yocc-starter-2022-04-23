        text: 'Slovakia joined the first phase of the New European Bauhaus through the Manifest2020 Platform, which became the first Slovak partner of the New European Bauhaus, an environmental, economic and cultural project of the European Commission. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) was presented by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union address in September 2020: "The New European Bauhaus is a project of hope. It is about finding a way to live better together in a post-pandemic world. It is about linking sustainability with good design and aesthetics to bring the ideas of the European Green Deal closer to the people. If the New European Bauhaus is to be successful, we need to bring together all creative minds such as designers, artists, scientists, architects together with citizens."'
