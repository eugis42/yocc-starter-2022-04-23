Warm Data Labs bring new societal responses to complex challenges. The speaker and moderator of the event will be Nora Bateson (USA), an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute based in Sweden. In her practice, she asks the question: "How can we improve our perception of the complexity in which we live so that we can improve our interaction with the world?". During the workshop, we invite project partners and guests to participate in a collaborative process that will not only bring us closer to understanding the need for a mental shift from climate crisis to climate care, but also bring us closer to each other.'
