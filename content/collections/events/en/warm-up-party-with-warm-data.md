        text: "Speaker and host of the event will be Nora Bateson herself. Nora Bateson\_ (USA) is an award-winning filmmaker, writer and educator, as well as President of the International Bateson Institute, based in Sweden. Her life's work asks the question “How can we improve our perception of the complexity we live within, so we may improve our interaction with the world?”. During the workshop the project partners and guests are invited to join a heartwarming experience that will not only bring us closer to understanding the need for a mental shift from Climate Crisis to Climate Care, but also will bring us closer to each other."
